# JobSat-Happi

This repository documents the key constructs tracked by the Ministry of Public Health (Thailand) "Happinometer" workforce-wellbeing and engagement survey. The tool supports biennial HR planning and retention by collecting data through the official web portal and mobile application during defined survey windows.

## Measurement domains
The Happinometer profiles respondents across nine happiness domains, each scored from 0 to 100:

1. **Happy Soul**
2. **Happy Heart**
3. **Happy Work Life**
4. **Happy Family**
5. **Happy Society**
6. **Happy Body**
7. **Happy Brain**
8. **Happy Relax**
9. **Happy Money**

An overall happiness profile is also produced at both individual and organizational levels.

### Organizational commitment (สามมิติ)
Commitment is summarized as an engagement score that blends:
- Positive advocacy for the organization
- Intention to stay
- Organizational pride

### Work–life balance
Reported as a separate 0–100 score alongside the nine happiness domains.

## Scoring interpretation
All domain and composite indices are normalized to a 0–100 scale. Results are grouped into the following bands to guide actions for individuals and organizations:

| Level         | Score range |
|---------------|-------------|
| Very Happy    | 75.00–100   |
| Happy         | 50.00–74.99 |
| Unhappy       | 25.00–49.99 |
| Very Unhappy  | 0.00–24.99  |

Commitment (engagement) levels are interpreted separately:

| Level | Score range |
|-------|-------------|
| High  | 80.00–100   |
| Medium| 60.00–79.99 |
| Low   | 0.00–59.99  |

## Administration cadence and population
- **Cadence:** Biennial administration (every two years).
- **Modality:** Web portal at [happinometer.moph.go.th](https://happinometer.moph.go.th) and the official mobile application.
- **Population:** Executives, civil servants, and permanent or contract health workers specified by MOPH guidance. Certain temporary groups may be excluded per policy.

## Outputs and action guidance
- **Individual reports:** Present the nine-domain profile, overall happiness level, commitment score, and work–life balance score.
- **Organizational reports:** Provide domain averages, rankings, happiness-level distributions, and commitment segmentation.

Action playbooks are tied to the interpretation bands above, helping leaders target counseling, culture, and retention interventions based on the observed happiness and engagement levels.
